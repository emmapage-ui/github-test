            <blockquote>“The very center and core of the whole Bible is the doctrine of the grace of God.”  –J. Gresham Machen</blockquote>
            <P>“Grace” is one of the most important concepts in the Bible, Christianity, and the world. It is most clearly expressed in the promises of God revealed in Scripture and embodied in Jesus Christ.Grace is the love of God shown to the unlovely, the peace of God given to the restless, the unmerited favor of God.</P>

    <h2><b>Definition of Grace</b></h2>
        <p>In Christian terms, grace can be defined as “God’s favor toward the unworthy” or “God’s benevolence on the undeserving.” In His grace, God is willing to forgive us and bless us, even though we fall short of living righteously. </p>
        <i><blockquote>"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). 

            "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through Him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God." (Romans 5:1-2)
            <br>

            But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me." (2 Corinthians 12:9)
            <br>
            <hr>
            "For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works." (Titus 2:11-14)
            <br>
            <hr>
            Modern, secular definitions of grace relate to a person's "elegance or beauty of form, manner, motion, or action; or a pleasing or attractive quality or endowment."</blockquote></i>

        <h4><b>Grace in the Bible</b></h4>
        <p>In the Bible, the concept of grace is a fundamental and significant theological concept that is central to Christian belief. Grace is often defined as the unmerited favor, kindness, and mercy of God. It is God's freely given, undeserved love and assistance to humanity, particularly in the context of salvation and forgiveness of sins.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Salvation:</b>Grace is often associated with God's act of providing salvation to humanity. In Christian theology, it is believed that salvation is not earned by human effort but is a gift from God through His grace. This is based on passages like Ephesians 2:8-9, which states, "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast."</li>

            <li><b>Forgiveness:</b>Grace is also closely tied to the forgiveness of sins. In the Bible, grace is seen as God's willingness to forgive and cleanse individuals of their sins when they repent and turn to Him. An example can be found in 1 John 1:9, which says, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</li>

            <li><b>Empowerment:</b>Grace is not just about forgiveness; it also provides the strength and empowerment to live a righteous and Godly life. This concept is sometimes referred to as "sufficient grace" and is exemplified in 2 Corinthians 12:9, where God tells the apostle Paul, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."</li>

            <li><b>Gods Love and Compassion:</b>Grace demonstrates God's love, mercy, and compassion toward humanity. It shows His willingness to reach out to people despite their imperfections and failures.</li>

            <li><b> Means of Access:</b>Grace is the means by which believers have access to God and are able to have a personal relationship with Him. Hebrews 4:16 encourages believers to "draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."</li>
